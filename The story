Anna Parket lives in a beautiful urban town of Dalhurst.

She has the perfect life working as a doctor at General Hospital in the next town called Modesto. 

Anna has lived with her boyfriend Tony Meadow for several years. Tony is the overseeing manager for Dalhurst's water plant. 

They live a happy, healthy life with their dogs across from Lake Median in a big house 
 sitting on a 2 acre property hidden within the woods. 
That house was inherited from Tony's grandparents few years back. Everybody knew Tony's grandparents, their dead was very unexpected and many neighbors and their friends came over to say good bye to them. Anna and Tony felt very welcomed there. They right the way fell in love with the town. People seem to be very happy in Dalhurst. Smiley faces wherever you look, kids running in the park, moms with strollers chatting and giggling, even joggers are smiling despite their running effort.
Both of them love their morning walks with dogs around the lake and their tea time on weekends at "Luna" Caffee. 

Lately, Tony has been away on a business trip for over a week. 
When she gets off her work shift, she comes home to her dogs and an empty house. 

Anna makes herself a pepporini pizza and decided to watch a movie called, "Shadow Noises".  

As she was watching the movie - she hears a noise coming from the basement. 

Anna is shocked by the noise and decides to call Tony on his cellphone. 
The phone rings 3 times and Tony doesn't answer.

Anna tries calling back one more time hoping that Tony picks up.
Tony never answers and Anna starts to get nervous as she walks toward the basement door.

Her stomach starts to turn and sweat starts to appear making her feel even more afraid.

As she opens the door, she notices the blade hovering above the ground.

She becomes overwealmed with fear and faints.
