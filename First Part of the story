Anna Parket lives in a beautiful urban town of Dalhurst.

She has the perfect life working as a doctor at General Hospital in the next town called Modesto. 

Anna has lived with her boyfriend Tony Meadow for several years. Tony is the overseeing manager for Dalhurst's water plant. 

They live a happy, healthy life with their dogs across from Lake Median in a big 3 story house 
that was inherited from Tony's grandparents.

The house sits on a 2 acre property hidden within the woods overseeing the lake. 

Lately, Tony has been away on a business trip for over a week. 
When she gets off her work shift, she comes home to her dogs and an empty house. 

Anna makes herself a pepporini pizza and decided to watch a movie called, "Shadow Noises".  

As she was watching the movie - she hears a noise coming from the basement. 

Anna is shocked by the noise and decides to call Tony on his cellphone. 
The phone rings 3 times and Tony doesn't answer.

Anna tries calling back one more time hoping that Tony picks up.
Tony never answers and Anna starts to get nervous as she walks toward the basement door.

Her stomach starts to turn and sweat starts to appear making her feel even more afraid.
